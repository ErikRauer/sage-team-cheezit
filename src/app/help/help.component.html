                        SAGE is played with two or more people, with one person
                        being the host and the other(s) playing the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The point of the game is for the player(s) to guess what the definition of a word is on a card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each word has four hints: a synonym, an antonymn, a general sense and an example usage.
                        A player may use a hint to help them guess the definition by pressing the hint button on the
                        card, but the hints are random.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each card starts with 5 points. Each time a hint is used, a point is deducted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the player(s) don't guess the definition correctly, move on to the next card. If they guess
                        correctly, press the "Got it!" button.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have fun!
